Histopathologic_Cancer_Detection_CNN

Description:
The goal of this project is to detect metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. Each image is labeled as either `0` (no cancer) or `1` (cancer present). The dataset consists of thousands of 96x96 pixel images, and the task is to build a deep learning model to classify these images accurately.

Dataset:
Train Data: A directory of training images and a CSV file containing image IDs and corresponding labels.
Test Data: A directory of test images (without labels) for which predictions need to be made.
Labels: Binary labels (`0` or `1`) indicating the presence of cancer.

Objective:
Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the images and predict whether they contain cancer.
